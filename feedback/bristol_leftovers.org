#+title: Bristol Leftovers
* Sam
- I said: the linking URL icon wasn't intuitive - didn't realise I had to click on it

- The purple flowers icons under action - was expecting to be able to settle the bill there

- Hard to distinguish between a transaction and a settlement, are both needed? I was doing duplicated steps before realising one was transaction and settlement

- Didn't understand the "share: " bit or the green stars

- When it comes to the settlement page, it'd be handy to see the descriptions, otherwise the rest of the transaction stuff was intuitive enough to work out

- *I thought I was doing duplicated steps before realising

Settle button (not sure if mark as settled or just go to create transaction)

- Me: with the flower icon, you mean something like
  - Settle
  - Edit
  - Permissions
  - Delete
  ?

- [thumbs up]

- Me: and I guess it would take you to the create transaction screen

- I guess you could always delete it instead of mark as settled but the latter was what I would look for intuitively

- Me: ohhh you mean like "this is done now I don't care about it any more"?

- [thumbs up]

- When you enter an amount and then select gbp it clears the amount field

- I don’t think it’s very clear when you’re switching between home view and transaction view

- Me: like clear how you navigate between them?

- Yes, and also which view you’re in and how they’re different
